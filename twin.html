            Yes, this is <bold>another</bold> attempt at a programming language from me :)
            However, this time I'm using a language I can actually enjoy - Rust
            <br>
            The repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/prodbysky/twin">prodbysky/twin</a>

            <br>
        </p>
        <h2 id="day1">Day 1 - Outline</h2>
        I feel like it's a necesity to outline what will this be, just so I know what I'm doing and what I'm trying to accomplish.
        This will be an imperative programming language with a decent(?) type system (fat enums, ...). No exceptions (errors as values).
        Simple syntax, easy to pick up, and all of this wrapped in good compiler errors with a gamified learning curve.
