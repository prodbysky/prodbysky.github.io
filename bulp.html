        <h1>bulp</h1>
        <p>
            This is a dev-log of my own programming language bulp,
            I heavily dislike C, because of nslc, I'm just not as experienced 
            as building a language in C requires me to be
            <br>
            The repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/prodbysky/bulp">prodbysky/bulp</a>
            <a href="#day1">Day 1</a>
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I feel like <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> might be a better choice for a compiler.
            Safer enums, more hand-holding memory management, testing built-in.
            So yes I'm going with Odin, all of this might just be peak delusion that a new language will fix my problems,
            but I truly believe in Odin for begin my savior. One last thing. This is my first project with Odin.
            <br>
            Rant over.
            <br>
            I began the day by going over the <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/">Odin Overview</a>, and
            first impressions? I like it. It's basic, but not as barebones as <a href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a>. Actual enums instead
            of the lazy actor that's in golang (yes I'll call it golang). Optionals (in the form of <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#maybet">Maybe</a>) even tho the 
            documentation suggests using multiple return arguments instead of this type is a decent addition.
            <br>
            The standard library seems cool :D
            <br>
            The fact that the majority(?) of libc is available is nice, I'll need to see how easy it is to integrate C code though.
            <br>
            Two last remarks
            <br>
            The <code>using</code> statement is a cool addition that makes refactoring code easier.
            <br>
            I don't have code examples for this, but it's easy to write concise basic code in Odin
            <br>
            Also did some parsing for binary operators, but testing comes tomorrow I need to sleep.
