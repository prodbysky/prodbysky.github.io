        <h1>bulp</h1>
        <p>
            This is a dev-log of my own programming language bulp,
            I heavily dislike C, because of nslc, I'm just not as experienced 
            as building a language in C requires me to be
            <br>
            The repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/prodbysky/bulp">prodbysky/bulp</a>

        <h2 id="day1">Day #1 - beginning of the bulp</h2>
        <p>
            I feel like <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a> might be a better choice for a compiler.
            Safer enums, more hand-holding memory management, testing built-in.
            So yes I'm going with Odin, all of this might just be peak delusion that a new language will fix my problems,
            but I truly believe in Odin for begin my savior. One last thing. This is my first project with Odin.
            <br>
            Rant over.
            <br>
            I began the day by going over the <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/">Odin Overview</a>, and
            first impressions? I like it. It's basic, but not as barebones as <a href="https://go.dev/">Golang</a>. Actual enums instead
            of the lazy actor that's in golang (yes I'll call it golang). Optionals (in the form of <a href="https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#maybet">Maybe</a>) even tho the 
            documentation suggests using multiple return arguments instead of this type is a decent addition.
            <br>
            The standard library seems cool :D
            <br>
            The fact that the majority(?) of libc is available is nice, I'll need to see how easy it is to integrate C code though.
            <br>
            Two last remarks
            <br>
            The <code>using</code> statement is a cool addition that makes refactoring code easier.
            <br>
            I don't have code examples for this, but it's easy to write concise basic code in Odin
            <br>
            Also did some parsing for binary operators, but testing comes tomorrow I need to sleep.
        </p>
        <h2 id="day2">Day #2 - allocators</h2>
        <p>
        To parse expressions I needed allocators, due to the recursive nature of AST's.
        <br>
        An AST node could just be a leaf (primary expression), or non-leaf (idk how to call them), eg. binary expressions.
        <br>
        So I went to the <a href = "https://pkg.odin-lang.org/core/">Odin docs</a> and tried to search for an arena or bump allocator,
        Since I'm so used to using them for parsing recursive structues. 
        I was pleased to find an <a href="https://pkg.odin-lang.org/core/mem/#Arena">arena</a>.
        From what I understand currently there are TWO arenas, one with dynamic backing memory, and static.
        Concerned with simplicity I went with the statically backed one. Other than that it was pretty easy.
        One annoying but not deal-breaking thing. Allocations return a rawptr, and an error, so I HAVE to
        define a new binding for the ptr which will have the AstNode type associated with it. Since I have only a single
        operator: `+`, instead of going the easy route, I immediately laid out the foundation for operator precedence.
        Since I implemented this in the morning, tests will come later in the day.
        </p>
        <h2 id="day3">Day #3 - More expressions, and the great decision</h2>
        <p>
        Working on it, I'm faced with a decision.
        <br>
        Should I just generate C?
        I mean yes that makes an extra dependency and effectively will make my language
        a C preprocessor, however somethings are just done more easily, and I'm not using
        llvm, since that is a HUGE dependency, and an AWFUL api I resent it heavily.
        <br>
        After thinking about it, you know what? fuck windows, lets do qbe
