        <h1>nslc</h1>
        <p>
            This is a dev-log of my own programming language nslc,
            that I'm making purely for fun (so far).
            I have decided to start this whole github pages thing, just
            because I want to have a visual way of viewing progress
            The repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/prodbysky/nslc">prodbysky/nslc</a>

        <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
        <p>
            Why am I doing this? Well for fun of course ;-;
            I began this project by sketching out the pipeline from source code to executable
            input.nsl -> tokenizer (lexer) -> ast parser -> type checker -> dead code analysis -> qbe -> executable
            So yes I will be using <a>qbe</a> as the compiler backend of choice, since this is my first try at a language
            Well not really, but the first serious no going back type of try
            I have already decided beforehand that I won't use any parser generators (yacc, ...) since I want full control other the language
            And yes before going on with the details, I tried to implement a language in Rust in the same name,
            However I just felt that something was off so I switched lanes to C
        </p>
        <h2 id="day1">Day #1 - beginning of the nslc?</h2>
        <p>
            Because I'm writing this after the work is done, it's going to be a short summary
            So we now have:
            A basic lexer that doesn't even report errors correctly
            An AST parser that uses a different way of parsing binary expressions than what I'm used to
            Instead of encoding the precedence of operators via recursion I decided to use a way
            I can't really describe
            A really basic QBE code generation library, that will grow as this language evolves
            Since so far it can only really add, subtract, divide and multiply numbers known
            at compile time, and return the result
            And a basic code generation module that uses the before mentioned QBE wrapper
            
        </p>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>
            <code>-fsanitize=address, -Wextra, -Wall</code> are my best buddies from now on.
            <a>Nob</a> as a build system is soooooo DAMN GOOD.
            Editing html from neovim is a pain for me.
        </p>
        <h2 id="day2">Day #2 - I was stumped</h2>
        <p>
            Woke up too early this morning, and found out my dad blocked my pc AND phone from the wifi
            Anyways I worked on slightly better error reporting. I've decided to use line and column numbers
            Did some minor things to make the code more readable
            Next variables? I think it's approapriate ( I don't know how to spell that :d )
            You thought. Tried to document some code instead found some serious bug that I'll debug later today.
            ...
            After a while of pondering, I found it:
        </p>
<pre><code>
loop {
    Statement s = parser_statement(&parser);
    if (s.type == ST_ERROR) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to parse file due to invalid statement\n");
        arrfree(parser.statements);
        parser.statements = NULL;
        return parser;
    }
    arrput(parser.statements, parser_statement(&parser));
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Yes so the whole time I was just calling the function that advanced the ast parser
            Stupid.
            Wow what a productive day :)
            I mean it's cool school is being like a clingy gf in my life
        </p>
        <p>
            Updated some parser and lexer functions to return just booleans instead of Statements to indicate failure
            Added parenthesized expressions (it was pretty easy tho)
        </p>
        <h2 id="day3">Day #3 - Variables (part 1.)</h2>
        <p>
            I need to decide on the way the variable assignments and definitions would look like.
            I could make it C styled: 
<pre><code>type name = expr;</code></pre>
            I could make it Rust/Zig like:
<pre><code>let / const name : type = expr;</code></pre>
        If I go with C like types will be mandatory to be specified if I don't want to end up like C++
        Sprinkling auto everywhere, and parsing will be harder since look-ahead would be necessary
        If I would go with Rust/JS etc... like statements type inference will be easier to integrate,
        since then the type will be tucked between the semicolon. Also AST parsing will be easier,
        since no look ahead is needed.
        Having weighed the options, I'll go with the more modern type.
        I haven't been showing any exact code but now this feature will make our AST parser and it's associated types
        more complicated:
<pre><code>
typedef enum {
    ST_RETURN,
    ST_VARIABLE_DEFINE, << Updated
    ST_ERROR
} StatementType;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>
typedef struct {
    StatementType type;
    union {
        Expr* ret;
        struct {
            char* name;
            char* type;
            Expr* value;
        } var_def; << new inner struct in the union :0
    } as;
} Statement;
</code></pre>
        Introducing the new enum value will stop the executable from being compiled, thanks gcc NOT DEFAULT warnings
        But this new construction (data) needs code to be created and utilized.
        So lets go. We need to expand our ast parser since the lexer does not YET differenciate between keywords and identifiers,
        it's unbothered by this feature so far.
<pre><code>
bool parser_statement(Parser* parser) {
    ...
    if (strcmp("let", parser_peek(parser).as.ident) == 0 || strcmp("const", parser_peek(parser).as.ident) == 0) {
        ... Implementation
        return true;
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

        Actually we need to add two new token types: a colon, it will separate our variable name and type,
        and an single equal sign.
    <br>
        Having made those changes, it was time to implement the parsing, and codegen.
        Parsing the AST was a breeeeze (just because we don't subject ourselves to error handling.
        Mostly just parser_next().
    <br>
        Also one thing I almost forgot. Primary expression parsing should be updated to handle variable names too.
        Now the part I fear the most. Code generation :0000
    <br>
        This feature requires to expand our qbe wrapper. We need store, load, stack alloc instructions
    <br>
        This has stumped me.
    <br>
        GOD THIS IS SO STUPID. 
    <br>
        I need to calm down and come back to this tomorrow. Codegen is broken and the fact is I CANT SEE THE ISSUE.
    <br>
        Alright I think tomorrow is the day. So today we have done some cool stuff. Parsing etc. even employed some error checking.
    <br>
        See y'all tomorrow.
